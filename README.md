# RayTracer

RayTracer is a simple Java implementation of the ray tracing algorithm. At the moment, the program is capable of rendering a single image of the scene.
The current scene consists of 5 spheres of differing colors spread across the viewing pane. So far, only diffuse and specular shading have been implemented
and there are no shadows. Below is a 1280x640 image showing the current state of the ray tracer.

## TODO

I plan to implement the following in the near future:
* Shadows
* Reflections
* Checkerboard floor
* More materials
* Aspect ratio
